# cronologic_linux_kernel
Linux Kernel Module that allows to map large PCIe DMA ring buffers.

It has been developed by cronologic GmbH & Co. KG to support the drivers for its time measurement devices such as.
* [xHPTDC8](https://www.cronologic.de/products/tdcs/xhptdc8-pcie) 8 channel 13ps streaming time-to-digital converter
* [xTDC4](https://www.cronologic.de/products/tdcs/xtdc4-pcie) 4 channel 13ps common-start time-to-digital converter
* [Timetagger](https://www.cronologic.de/products/tdcs/timetagger) 500ps low cost TDCs
* [Ndigo6G-12](https://www.cronologic.de/products/adcs/ndigo6g-12) 6.4 Gsps 12 bit ADC digitizer board with pulse extraction and 13ps TDC.
* [Ndigo5G-10](https://www.cronologic.de/products/adcs/cronologic-ndigo5g-10) 5 Gsps 10 bit ADC digitizer board with pulse extraction

However, the module could be useful to any PCIe developer who is using large buffers that are scattered in PCI space but shall look contiguous in user space. 

The user mode part of the driver is available in a separate repository.

The initial code has been written by   with support from [Richard Weinberger](https://github.com/richardweinberger). It is licensed unter [GPL3](LICENSE).
